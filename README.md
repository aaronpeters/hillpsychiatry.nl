## What is it?

A simple template for building a fast, static website using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) static site generator, with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) baked-in, ready to deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in a couple of clicks.

Use it as a starter for your own projects or as an easy way to get started building websites with Eleventy.

Based on the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) repo (see there for additional info on Eleventy usage).
