# Your Website, Blazing Fast ðŸ”¥ ðŸš€

I'd love to help you improve speed and performance of your website  - if you are serious about this. 
Achieving high-performance for your site, short-term and long-term, requires investing time and money and putting in the effort.

My approach to making websites fast can be described as "implementing data-driven, validated optimizations in context of user characteristics/needs and business goals, in close collaboration with your teams and third parties".

Typically a project has four key ingredients:

- Data & Insights
- Knowledge Transfer
- Get Fast
- Stay Fast

At the end of the project, your website is fast and your teams have the enthusiasm, data, expertise, tools and processes to keep the site fast.
