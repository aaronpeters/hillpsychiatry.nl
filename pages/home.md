# Web Performance Consultant & Engineer

Since 2010, I help medium and large businesses make their website blazing fast, secure and Google-friendly, resulting in more traffic, lower costs and higher revenue.

In my toolbox is an up-to-date and deep understanding of browsers, protocols, networking, CDNs, modern web technologies and UX/performance best practices. 
More importantly - there is <strong>10 years experience in <i>doing</i> web performance optimization</strong> in close cooperation with marketing, product and engineering teams, on location and remote.
