### Addy Osmani

Addy is an Engineering Manager at Google working on Chrome. 
In 2018, he wrote a 'famous' article [The Cost Of JavaScript In 2018](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4
) on Medium. Not to my suprise, on June 25 2019 Addy published the follow-up [The cost of JavaScript in 2019](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019) and again it's packed with useful information that any frontend developer must know.<br>

### Performance Calendar

"The speed geek's favorite time of the year" is the tagline of the famous Performance Calendar.
Since 2009, Stoyan Stefanov has been able to get web performance experts and advocats to write articles and publish those on the Performance Calendar.
The concept is simple: from December 1 through December 31, one new article is published every day. 
The [Performance Calendar](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/) is an archive of high-quality and often lenghty web performance articles, packed with tips and insights.
