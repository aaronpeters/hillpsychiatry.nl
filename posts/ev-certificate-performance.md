- Browsers don't show green bar anymore, so why pay way more for EV cert?
- Better security? No. Good security comes from strong cipher suites, etc. EV adds nothing.
- Browser must check revoke status _every time_ : blocking request to the CA
- CA server sloooow or down? User experience is crap, brand damaged, revenue missed out
