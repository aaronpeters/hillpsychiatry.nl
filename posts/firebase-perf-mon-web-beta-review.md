## Takeaways

* Do not assume a snippet provided by a third party is optimized for performance
* Defer the loading of third party scripts until after the load event (even if loaded async)
* Inline JS should go in the top of <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> (before CSS)
* Ensure your snippet always references the latest version of the standalone SDK: check the Firebase Performance Monitoring web site regularly
