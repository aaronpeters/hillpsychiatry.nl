During the past three months, I've researched the impact of the  _type_ of SSL/TLS certificate on website speed and reliability and the effectiveness of OCSP stapling. 

Two days ago, I published my research in the article [EV Certificates Make The Web Slow and Unreliable](https://www.aaronpeters.nl/blog/ev-certificates-make-the-web-slow-and-unreliable/), with the key take-aways being:

<!-- Two days ago, I published [EV Certificates Make The Web Slow and Unreliable](https://www.aaronpeters.nl/blog/ev-certificates-make-the-web-slow-and-unreliable/). The article describes my research into the impact of the  _type_ of SSL/TLS certificate on web performance and the effectiveness of OCSP stapling. The key take-aways  are: -->

<!-- - EV certificates are a _very_ bad choice from a web performance perspective
- Your best option is a DV certificate, served with a valid OCSP staple -->

<!-- - If you care about web performance, do not use an EV certificate
- Your best option is a DV certificate, served with a valid OCSP staple -->

- Do not use an EV certificate
- For optimal performance, serve a DV certificate with a valid OCSP staple

<!-- Knowing the _type_ of certificate and OCSP stapling are important, I wanted to know what the big websites in NL are serving today. Are EV certificates popular?  -->

Having analyzed only a handful of Dutch websites in scope of my research, I was hungry for a bigger and better view on the state of SSL/TLS certificates in The Netherlands.

<!-- Still hungry for more data and insights, 
In scope of my research I analyzed a few NL websites and I was left hungry for more data and insights. I was especially interested in having a good view on the state of SSL/TLS certificates in The Netherlands. -->
<!-- Are EV certificates popular in NL? Do many NL sites serve their DV certificate with a stapled OCSP response? -->

I carefully created a list of 500 high-traffic/premium brand NL websites, wrote a script that collects data for each domain and took that data to Google Sheet for analysis and charting.

The spreadsheet made me sad ðŸ˜¢

**62% of the top NL websites serve a SSL/TLS certificate that hurts web performance**

Let's walk through the data.

<!-- ## <a name="a"></a>How collected the data

Bash script
For each website, run a few OpenSSL commands, store results in a local file 
Google Sheet

Has OCSP staple?

`echo QUIT | openssl s_client -servername www.cloudflare.com -connect www.cloudflare.com:443 -status 2> /dev/null | grep -A 17 'OCSP response:' | grep -B 17 'Next Update'`

If the certificate is _not_ stapled, the command will show _no_ output. -->


## Sadly, EV Certificates Are Quite Popular

Extended Validation certificates are expensive, a hassle to acquire and provide zero security benefits since browsers stopped showing the 'green bar'.
However, [EV certs _do_ make your website slower and less robust](/blog/ev-certificates-make-the-web-slow-and-unreliable/#ev-cert-perf).

I expected maybe 10% of the big NL sites to serve an EV certificate, but unfortunately the number is much higher:

### 50% of DV/OV Certificates Are Not OCSP Stapled
