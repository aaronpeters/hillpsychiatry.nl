Fonts, scripts, images, widgets ... millions

During the past three months, I've researched the impact of the  _type_ of SSL/TLS certificate on website speed and reliability and the effectiveness of OCSP stapling. 

On January 28, I published my research in the article [EV Certificates Make The Web Slow and Unreliable](https://www.aaronpeters.nl/blog/ev-certificates-make-the-web-slow-and-unreliable/), with the key take-aways being:

<!-- Two days ago, I published [EV Certificates Make The Web Slow and Unreliable](https://www.aaronpeters.nl/blog/ev-certificates-make-the-web-slow-and-unreliable/). The article describes my research into the impact of the  _type_ of SSL/TLS certificate on web performance and the effectiveness of OCSP stapling. The key take-aways  are: -->

<!-- - EV certificates are a _very_ bad choice from a web performance perspective
- Your best option is a DV certificate, served with a valid OCSP staple -->

<!-- - If you care about web performance, do not use an EV certificate
- Your best option is a DV certificate, served with a valid OCSP staple -->

- Do not use an EV certificate
- For optimal performance, serve a DV or OV certificate with a valid OCSP staple

<!-- Knowing the _type_ of certificate and OCSP stapling are important, I wanted to know what the big websites in NL are serving today. Are EV certificates popular?  -->

Having analyzed only a handful of Dutch websites in scope of my research, I was hungry for a bigger and better view on the state of SSL/TLS certificates in The Netherlands.

<!-- Still hungry for more data and insights, 
In scope of my research I analyzed a few NL websites and I was left hungry for more data and insights. I was especially interested in having a good view on the state of SSL/TLS certificates in The Netherlands. -->
<!-- Are EV certificates popular in NL? Do many NL sites serve their DV certificate with a stapled OCSP response? -->

I carefully created a list of 500 high-traffic/premium brand NL websites, wrote a script that collects data for each domain and took that data to Google Sheet for analysis and charting.

The spreadsheet made me sad ðŸ˜¢

**70% of the top NL websites serve a SSL/TLS certificate that hurts web performance**

Let's walk through the data.

<!-- ## <a name="a"></a>How collected the data

Bash script
For each website, run a few OpenSSL commands, store results in a local file 
Google Sheet

Has OCSP staple?

`echo QUIT | openssl s_client -servername www.cloudflare.com -connect www.cloudflare.com:443 -status 2> /dev/null | grep -A 17 'OCSP response:' | grep -B 17 'Next Update'`

If the certificate is _not_ stapled, the command will show _no_ output. -->


## Sadly, EV Certificates Are Quite Popular

Extended Validation certificates are relatively expensive, a hassle to acquire, don't make your site more secure _and_ since all modern browsers stopped showing the 'green bar' they also no longer provide users that 'enhanced perception of trust' (which is a myth anyway).

However, [EV certs _do_ make your website slower and less robust](/blog/ev-certificates-make-the-web-slow-and-unreliable/#ev-cert-perf), much more so than DV and OV certificates.

I expected maybe 10% of the big NL sites to serve an EV certificate, but unfortunately it's more than 2x that: 
<!-- **One out of four top NL websites uses an EV certificate**. -->

<img loading="lazy" class="responsive-ugh" src="/static/img/24percent-of-websites-have-an-ev-certificate.svg" width="548" height="339" alt="24 percent of top NL websites have an EV certificate">

Bol.com, Coolblue and HEMA are just a few of the big brands that serve the slow EV certificate.

## Stapling DV/OV Certificates is Not Very Common

The 76% of NL websites that don't use an EV certificate have made the right decision. 
[DV/OV certificates are the better choice from a web performance perspective](/blog/ev-certificates-make-the-web-slow-and-unreliable/#dv-cert-perf), even if the certificate does not have a stapled "not revoked" OCSP response.

That said, OCSP stapling _does_ add real value because in Firefox this effectively gets rid of a blocking request to the Certificate Authority's server very early in the page load process. This request easily takes 100 ms and for some visitors probably much longer.

Unless you're using a CDN that will do it for you, OCSP stapling doesn't just magically happen.
Activation/implementation requires time and effort.
Perhaps this is why only 40% of the 378 websites that serve a DV or OV certificate have it stapled.

Example websites that should put OCSP stapling on their to-do list are Wetransfer, Funda and TUI.

## Most of Top NL Websites Should Serve a Better Certificate

122 websites serve an EV certificate and 228 serve a non-OCSP stapled DV/OV certificate. 

122 + 228 = 350 and 350 / 500 = 70%.

So, the _majority_ of high-traffic/premium brand websites in NL are doing it wrong and consequently provide a suboptimal user experience.

Assuming 25000 new HTTPS connections are established with the servers of those 350 websites on average every day by browsers that send that blocking request to the Certificate Authority, and the request to the CA takes 100 ms, then the total time of users wasted _daily_ is 875000 seconds or roughly 10 days.

<strong>Update: February 1, 2020</strong><br>
  My initial data set contained ~10% false positives and ~4% false negatives for 'DV/OV certificates with OCSP staple', due to a mistake in my data collection script.<br>
  I fixed my script, collected fresh data and updated this article.

<!-- NL devs, we can fix this, right? -->
<!-- The Web is slow enough even _with_ high-performance SSL/TLS certificates.  -->

<!-- If you believe there _is_ a strong argument in favour of using an EV certificate, or a good reason to _not_ staple your DV/OV certificate ... please grab me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aaronpeters).  -->
